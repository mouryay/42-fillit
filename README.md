Fillit is a 42 School Project where you need to write a program to fit a given set of tetriminoes into the smallest possible square.

Basically you read the file and you look for illegal characters. If you find an illegal character, you print error and exit, otherwise save the co-ordinates of the tetrimino blocks in an array (or a linkedlist if you prefer). Once you save it, you try to place all of them in the smallest possible square (an array). This is where the algorithm comes in. They call it the 'backtracking algorithm'. I did not understand it until I actually wrote it down and executed it. So don't worry if you feel clueless. You will be clueless until you are not.
